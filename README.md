# FoodCast

Now a days we’re all so occupied with daily tasks and projects, that simple decisions often seem impossible to make. This simple project tackles one we’re all too familiar with, figuring out what to eat! By joining together a few APIs we’ve provided an app that suggests meals or snacks based on the weather and the city provided. 

## Usage

- Search the city you’d like to pull suggestions for, then

- Sit back and find your craving from a few local eateries recommended by mother nature!

Here the app begins as a single page site, type in your city of choice:

Depending on the weather which you’ll also get data on, the app will suggest a type of food and restaurants within the area that serve that given cuisine.

You’ll see here in sunny Los Angeles, CA the heat calls for something fresh like a parfait, and the restaurants provided all have that as a menu option:

Below, we have a different location whose weather wouldn’t really call for a cold food. Rather, the cold & clouds of St. Pierre recommend soup:

## Contribution & Technologies
With the help of [Jose Antunez]( https://github.com/JoseAntunez81), [Jennifer Vo]( https://github.com/Unikwalk), and APIs from Yelp and OpenWeather we were able to develop this simple project.
